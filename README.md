# D_NN - A Neural Network written in D.

## Status

This is not yet ready for production use.  This started mainly as an experiment
and is will still be worked on to create a more optimized/configurable version.
This document will be updated as things progress, but in the meantime look at
source/app.d to see how it currently can be used.

Also, do note that this is may or may not get updates.  If this is something
that you absolutely need in your project and you need a more up to
date/configurable/powerful/etc. version, please feel free to make your own copy
and run with it.  All I ask is that I get a link back to your code so that I
can include it into the README.

## Plan

The current plan is as follows:

1. Ensure the current version is somewhat feature complete.
1. Document the current implementation.
1. Make the current implementation the reference implementation.
1. Create a copy of the current implementation and optimize the code as much as possible.
